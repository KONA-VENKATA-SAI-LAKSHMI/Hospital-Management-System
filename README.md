Task From TCS to create a WEBPAGE using PYTHON FLASK

Quick Steps:

1.  Pull the files from the development branch
2.  Create a virtual environment (`python -m venv .hms`) and make sure you add the _environment folder_ to **.gitignore** if you used a different name than **.hms.**
3.  Activate the virtual environment (`.hms\Scripts\activate`)
4.  Install the requirements using the command "`pip install -r requirements.txt`"
5.  If you are adding or installing any other flask components (_pip packages_), please add it to the requirements.txt file `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.
6.  Commit early and often using relevant messages.

> _\*Steps 2 and 3 are optional but highly recommended._
> 
> Reason: you can just use the command "pip freeze > requirements.txt" to selectively output the required components to be installed (say, WTForms).  
> Otherwise all the pip packages in your system will get added to the requirements.txt file _(please don't do that)_.
